# Visual Translator Demo

Welcome to the **Visual Translator Demo**! This project is part of the **Entrepreneur First Hackathon 2025** in Zurich. Our goal is to create a translation companion that enhances the way people interact with their environment, enabling them to translate objects they can see and capture in real-time.

By simply uploading or selecting an image and clicking on the object you want to observe and translate, you‚Äôll receive not only a translation but also a description, with sample sentences to help you better understand the context of the object.

## üöÄ Features

- **Upload or Select Images**: Choose an image from your computer or use one of the default examples to get started.
- **Click to Annotate**: Click on the object you want to translate, and the system will annotate the image with an arrow.
- **Model Selection**: Choose from two state-of-the-art translation models, SmolVLM and PaliGemma.
- **Translation and Descriptions**: Receive the translation of the object along with a description and three sample sentences for better context.
- **Gradio Interface**: A user-friendly interface that makes it easy to interact with the tool.
